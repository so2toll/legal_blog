No one wants to be a victim, but when something happens there can be recourse. Filing for a police report can be the first formal step that saves key facts and enables later actions such as applying for victim compensation. This article gives steps on how to file a police report, whether online or in person, what information is needed such as a police number or case number, how to obtain copies, and how the report fits into the compensation process. For further instance, check out Claims Advocacy services to see how much compensation you could qualify for:

## When you should file a police report

Some survivors question whether or not their crime is “serious enough” to obtain a report. To be clear, if you were harmed you deserve for it to be documented. You can consider these when thinking about filing a report:


* Has a crime occurred (e.g., whether it’s an assault, robbery, burglary, identity theft or another incident)?
* Was some kind of property stolen or damaged?
* Will you likely need  some kind of official documentation for insurance purposes, your employer, or a police case number and file for victim compensation claims?

Although in many cases it’s possible to make a report and file a claim for crimes that occurred some time in the past, if possible, be sure to file promptly. Most compensation programs require a police report and can have a time limit for starting a claim. For more clarity, be sure to contact a local victim advocate or your police department’s non-emergency number. If you have an emergency, always dial 911. 

## File a Police Report Online
For most jurisdictions, you have the option of filing a police report online or in-person. Choose the path that is best for you. To make a report you can either:  
* Make a police report online: This is typically suited for non-violent incidents (i.e. vehicle theft, vandalism, etc.). Using a local online portal, you can generate a reference number or police case number. Look for the option to file police report online on your local city or county police department’s website. 
* Make an in-person report: This can be better suited for incidents that involve violence, injuries or physical evidence that needs collection. An in-person report allows officers to potentially document injuries with photography and potentially answer questions more directly. To look for a nearby location, you can search find a police station near me or call the non-emergency number (unless it is an actual emergency) to ask for the right location.

Whether you make a police report online or in-person depends on your situation both methods are valid. Reporting online could offer privacy and speed. But going the in-person route can give you more direct support and more assurance around evidence preservation.


## Information Needed Before Filing a Police Report 
Requirements for filing may vary from place to place, but in general having certain details ready beforehand can help speed the process and fortify potential problems in the future. Consider these things for a smoother process:
* Location: Have ready the incident time, date, and place
* Description What happened: A good retelling of what happened. Give a timeline  of events that’s factual as best as you can
* Witnesses Who saw it: Tell them who saw the incident. Give contact details and names of potential witnesses
* Vehicle Descriptions: If relevant, have details about license plates and vehicle information that can add support to the filing
* Photo evidence: Prepare visuals, videos and photos from the incident. This includes property damage, injuries, property damage, or the scene in general
* Documentation: Evidence in the form of documents such as health records, billing costs or receipts and invoices you’ve incurred from the incident 

For plans to apply for victim compensation, be sure to keep all medical invoices and receipts. Once you file your report, be sure to take note of the police report number as it’s one of the main identifiers for a compensation claim and insurance claims.

## What Happens After Making a Police Report
After you file a report, you will obtain a police report number or incidence case id. You will use this number to: Once you've filed your report, you'll receive a police report number or confirmation ID. This number is your key to everything that comes next:
* Check status: Most police departments now have online portals that allow you to check on your police report status. If they have a website, you can search for their check police status section or directly call the records unit. 
* Request a copy: Different departments have different processing time expectations. This can range anywhere from a few days to several weeks depending on the department’s caseload or if more investigation is required.
* Share with relevant people: If there are other stakeholders involved in your incident, you will want to provide your police report number to them. This may be your victim claims advocate, insurance company or even employer (if necessary time off for instance)

If you feel that after you file a police report your response is delayed or you haven’t obtained a copy for whatever reason, be sure to reach out to the records division for more information. They may give you details on expected data or at least acknowledge that the police report filing is processing.
