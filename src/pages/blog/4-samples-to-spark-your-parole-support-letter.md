## Parole support letter from mother
Date
__________ Parole Board
Address
City, State, Zip
Re: Prisoners Name, _DC#
Name of Prison (where they're at)
Address
City, State, Zip
Dear Honorable Members of the Parole Board:
My name is (your name). I am (inmate full name)  mother.
(Do not write in capitals)

When my boy was born, I turned into a very proud mother, and I still am. My son has the biggest heart. I know you may not know but I know he's only a number in your system, but he honestly does have a great heart. 

I feel my boy has done his time and I feel he needs to be home with me.

My health condition is really slowing me down, making it difficult to travel to go see my son but I will continue to make the trips no matter if it does slow me down. I want to know if my boy has any chance of early release.

If my son does come home, I have 2 friends that are willing to hire him, in their place of business.

They are willing to give him employment, so all he needs is a chance in life. My son has missed out on his son's life, and but my grandson has finished school. Now he might even be a father.

All I'm asking is give me another chance with my son. I would love my son to have a chance to be able to know his grandbaby.

## Sample parole support letter from family
The background of this parole support letter is for a brother. The sister is vouching for her brother on how he was their role model growing up and she also talks about how she has been a contributing citizen herself and helping him won't be an issue.

{Your address}
{City, State, Zip}
{Date}
{Recepient's address}
{City, State, Zip}
Dear Honorable Members of the Parole Board:

My name is ____________ and I am writing respectfully request that my brother, 

____________, be granted parole.

(inmates name) is three years older than I am, and while we were growing up he played the role of protector and confidant. He is sensitive, kind, honest and caring.

I can't have imagined a better role model growing up.

Sadly, (inmate name) got into controlled substances in high school, and was ultimately arrested, tried and sent to prison for possession and sale of methamphetamines. While it's 
True that my brother used and sold drugs, he was always a peaceful man and never engaged in other illegal activities such as theft to support his habit.

(inmate name) accepts full responsibility for his crimes. Through the drug treatment program offered through the prison system, as well as counseling during visits by our family pastor, has examined why he turned to drugs and is committed to staying clean when he is released.

Perhaps due in part to my brother's influence, I went to college and am now employed as a high school counselor. I can tell when someone is trying to "pull one over on me," and this is not the case with my brother. If (inmate name) is granted parole, I will not hesitate to welcome him into my home, including building a relationship with my two young children
Sincerely,
{name}

## Parole letters of support from friends
The background of this letter is that the inmate is innocent according to the letter and was already denied parole before.

Board of Probation and Parole
Attn: Inmate Inquiry
{board mailing address}
Regarding Parole Hearing for: {inmate full name & inmate number}
{inmate full name} has her next parole hearing scheduled for {date}. 

As a concerned citizen interested in helping {inmate name} successfully transition into life outside prison, I am writing to as that you please parole for her at this hearing.

She/He has served over X years of a {amount of time was given to inmate} year sentence for {crime commited}, even though the average sentence for that charge is 10-15 years. She is still in prison years after her minimum sentence despite having no major disciplinary problem in the last three decades.

The document provided to Ms.Sims for her last parole denial in June 2013 is lists the reasons for the denial as:

"Your minimization/denial of the nature and circumstances of the offense(s) committed, "and
"The negative recommendation made by the prosecuting attorney."

I am concerned that Ms. Sims maintaining her innocence is seen as an attempt to minimize or deny the nature and circumstances of the offense(s), even while there is evidence that corroborates that the shot was fired from a location where it is well known she was nowhere near.

This phenomenon is referred to as "the innocent prisoner's dilemma" by law professor
Daniel Medwed who asserts that it is unfair and unethical to require a prisoner who may have been wrongly convicted to provide false admission of guilt or remorse.

In regards to the negative recommendation made by the prosecuting attorney, I believe this is outweighed by the fact that the officials at SCI Cambridge Springs, where Ms. Sims is held, have recommended her for parole.

These are the prison guards and personnel that she has contact with on a day-to-day basis as opposed to the prosecuting attorney who had no contact with her at all in decades.

Debbie Sims has now spent most of her life in prison, and the recidivism rate for people released at her age is very low. Please grant parole and allow her to be a part of, and contribute to, society as a free citizen, a loving mother, and grandmother.

Sincerely,
(your name)

## Sample parole support letter from employer

The background of this letter is that a retired MDOC employee is vouchering for the person incarcerated and is talking about the accomplishments the inmate has done while incarcerated.

Chairman Michigan Parole Board
Michigan Department of Corrections
P.O. Box 30003
Lansing, MI 48909
RE: Johnson, Michael Jeffery #159608
Dear Parole Board,

As a retired MDOC employee, I would like to be afforded the opportunity to express my support for parole for Michael Jeffery Johnson.

I have known him since 1980 after his arrival at MCF, where I was employed as a Resident Unit Manager for approximately 29 years. As with most arrivals, many prisoners arrive with little of anything. In his case, he managed to use his time wisely!

The Parole Board is well aware of his accomplishments, but I witnessed the changes firsthand. I know that he is a changed man! Not only has he been remorseful, but he had also developed into an law-abiding and respectful person. He ha snot been selfish with himself, as I know that on many occasions he has guided other young men into respectful conduct.

Besides being an educated and well-read individual, he is a very talented artist and is very innovative with ideas. Not only does he have close family ties and support, a feature that many incarcerated individuals lack, but he has community support as well.

I am optimistic that when released, he will continue as a positive, law-abiding, and hardworking individual!

Sincerely,
Your name
