For those facing a longer sentence, prison stores also sell other amenities such as radios, MP3 players, and small televisions that can be used at specified times of the day.

              <p>They can't receive pictures of themselves for a few reasons due to safety.
                If photos are for some reason acquired by someone else they can use the photo to plan an assault, give to the media, and even used to create a fraudulent ID.
