                            We know you do a lot for your inmate – the phone calls, the visits, the letters, but keeping their spirits up in between those phone calls and visits can make the difference in them having a really good day, or a bad one. We take out all the extra steps for you – so you can literally send them photos from anywhere! To preserve the quality of your photo, we will not edit, resize or change your photos, and will ship it exactly as it’s uploaded. Send your inmate those photos today!

                            I had signed up with Claims Advocacy and in jail, they told my daughter it was a scam site so I had to cancel my whole card and get another 1. Then my daughter calls and says she got my letter and picture through Claims Advocacy. I was super excited now I got to sign up all over again I’m waiting on my new card to do so.
